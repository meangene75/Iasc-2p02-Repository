## Analysis of Visualization in Literature
by Eugene Payne 

Graphs are good for cataloging and storing information in them, but finding these in articles and other readings is usually a rare sight. Using graphs in this way can help us interpret things in a new light, and can broaden the perception of the reader if done right. Such are the arguments of Franco Moretti and Johanna Druker, who agree that moving from written to visual mediums is beneficial to the reader.  

Moretti presented a lot of graphs that showed the rise and fall of different genres of novel in multiple countries. His use of graphs illustrates the points that he makes in the article; that novels had a massive increase in interest in the 1700’s to 1800’s, and after the1900’s the population's desire for novels began to drop(p.68 to p.75). This is conveyed by switching from written text to visual graphs acting as evidence to the arguments made. The way that this is achieved is by treating the graphs and written work as one. In Moretti’s words ”it’s a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole—and the graphs that follow are one way to begin doing this.”(p.67). By implementing graphs into his work he not only presents proof in his writing, but also gives a visual interpretation of that evidence.

Druker also used many graphs in her article as well, and had a way of thinking that helped implement these graphs in her work. The data found in the graphs should be seen as capta, meaning that the information is not concrete and is open to interpretation by the reader. In her words “Data are capta, taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it.”(sct.8). Being able to interpret the information in their own way, the reader is able to think about information through a multimodal medium in a more critical light. However I don’t agree with the way that Druker presents the graphs, because of how needlessly complicated it seems. Because of the subjective nature of the information, Druker believed that the graphs should take a more subjective format as well. This makes the graphs resemble art more than a graph, and makes it unnecessarily harder for the reader to interpret. For example in the article she presents us with a standard graph that shows the population of males and females in 7 different nations. The problem is that it does not account for questions such as what counts as a nation, what classifies as male, and other parameters. Druker’s solution is to format the graph in a way that adds gradients, fades, and other graphical changes to let the reader interpret more things such as temporality and fluctuations in gender. All though this allows for more interpretation, it also makes the information harder to obtain, and can still achieve while maintaining more structure. 

Let us look at another reading for example, such as Gender and Cultural Analytics: Finding or Making Stereotypes by Laura Mandell. To make a visualisation of the text in this reading I used voyant which took the reading and visualizes the frequency at which the words are used in the text.

By looking at this visualization I am able to interpret what the article is about and what the main points are. Based on the fact that gender is one of the most frequent words in the text you can interpret that gender plays a large role in this reading. Using the link tool you can even see how gender relates to other themes in the text. It seems that gender is connected to words like analysis and culture, so the reader could interpret that this reading not only talks about genders, but analysis them along with the different cultures that recognise multiple genders. By using these visualizations along with the text it not only helps the reader understand the content better, but lets the reader interpret their own meaning of the text and data. This is also achieved through multiple visuals that broaden the readers take on the data, instead of one visual trying to describe multiple sets of data. 

In conclusion, Moretti and Druker are right to want more engaging literature, and are right to say that it benefits the readers and authors. Moving form written to visual mediums should be a staple in digital humanities, and all articles.
